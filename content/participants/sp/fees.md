TENET hereby gives notice that the following fees model for Service Providers will apply from 1 May 2019:

## Non-recurring costs

A once-off take-on charge of ***R 2 400*** will be levied for new each production entity registered under the [SAML2 technology profile]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/_index.md" >}}) to cover the [administrative overheads]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/sp-requirements/_index.md" >}}) of processing a new service provider registration.

Where service providers ask SAFIRE to assist with integration, and where SAFIRE [is able to provide such assistance,]({{< ref "/participants/support.md" >}}) we reserve the right to recover any additional costs we incur at our prevailing consulting rates. This would be negotiated in advance on a per-case basis.

## Annual recurring costs

SAFIRE does not charge service providers a participation fee, and there are no recurring costs for participating in SAFIRE as a service provider.

## Discounts and exemptions

- ***All SAFIRE's fees are waived until 31 December 2019. SPs joining before this date will not be charged.***
- Institutions that are beneficiaries under TENET's REN Services Agreement at the time of their on-boarding are exempt from SAFIRE's fees provided that the sum of the preceeding 12 months' Agency Fee was greater than or equal to the equivalent SAFIRE fee.
- Non-profit or public benefit organisations properly registered as such in South Africa may request a discount.
- The [SAFIRE Steering Committee]({{< ref "/governance.md" >}}) may, at its sole discretion, elect to discount or exempt any organisation from paying SAFIRE's fees. Such discretion may be applied on recommendation from a [Member]({{< ref "/participants/idp/list.md" >}}) or the operations staff.
