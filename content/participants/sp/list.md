Below is a list[^1] of participants in SAFIRE who currently act as service providers and provide services to others. You can click on a participant to find out more.

{{< participantlist type="sp" >}}

Note that this isn't a full list of services that are available to SAFIRE participants --- we connect to many useful services via [eduGAIN](https://technical.edugain.org/entities) too. We've made [special provision for some of these](https://phph.safire.ac.za/overview?filter=fed%3A%5Eedugain.org%24%20SP%3A%5E%24%20approved%3A%5E%24) to ensure they work properly, and also automatically support those that are categorised as [Research & Scholarship](https://phph.safire.ac.za/overview?filter=fed%3A%5Eedugain.org%24%20SP%3A%5E%24%20entcat%3A%5ERaS%24).

You might also be interested in a list of [library services & information providers]({{< ref "/technical/resources/library-services.md" >}}) known to work with SAFIRE.

If a service you'd like to use is not listed here, let them know you'd like to be able to use your home account to be able to log into their service.
