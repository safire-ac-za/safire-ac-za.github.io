title: Configuring ADFS for SAFIRE

In order to configure Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) as an identity provider for SAFIRE, you need to do four things:

  1. Create a Relying Party  Trust that fetches the [federation hub's metadata](https://metadata.safire.ac.za/safire-hub-metadata.xml) from https://metadata.safire.ac.za/safire-hub-metadata.xml
  2. Configure claim rules to map AD LDAP attributes to [SAFIRE's attributes](/technical/attributes/)
  3. Configure a claim rule to [generate eduPersonAffiliation]({{< ref "/technical/resources/generating-edupersonaffiliation.md" >}}) from some internal role mapping
  4. Configure a claim rule to generate a transient NameID and then map this internal claim as a Name ID of type urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient

## Scripted configuration

You can use PowerShell to configure ADFS, and there is a sample [add-safire-relyingparty.ps1](/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/add-safire-relyingparty.ps1.txt) script to automatically add SAFIRE as a relying party.

This script needs one piece of information from you --- your primary DNS domain name, which will be used to configure scopes on those attributes that require it. It can be specified as -idpScope or you will be prompted for it.

The script creates a Claim Issuance Policy that generates as many of SAFIRE's attributes as possible from the default AD schema, including all the [recommended attributes](/technical/attributes/). If you have other values in your AD that map to other SAFIRE attributes, you should consider adding those mappings to.

Without knowing about your internal structure, it is impossible for the script to [generate a complete eduPersonAffiliation]({{< ref "/technical/resources/generating-edupersonaffiliation.md" >}}). If you look through the script, you will find a  "Transform Group to eduPersonAffiliation" rule that adds all members of the Domain Users group as members of your organisation ([case 5]({{< ref "/technical/resources/generating-edupersonaffiliation.md#case-5-everyone-is-a-member" >}})). This rule can be expanded or adapted to better fit your situation (cf [case 2]({{< ref "/technical/resources/generating-edupersonaffiliation.md#case-2-group-membership" >}})). For instance, the "Domain Users" group can be changed to one that better fits your environment. Likewise, you may have groups that reflect the other values in the [eduPersonAffiliation vocabulary]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonaffiliation.md" >}}).

## Claim Descriptions

Whilst not strictly necessary, you can also add user-friendly claim descriptions to the new claims we've created. This makes them display better in the AD FS Management interface.

The following PowerShell snippet adds a claim description for the [eduPersonPrincipalName]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonprincipalname.md" >}}) attribute:

```powershell
if ("urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6" -notin @(Get-AdfsClaimDescription | foreach { $_.ClaimType }))
{
    Add-AdfsClaimDescription -ClaimType "urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6" `
      -Name "eduPerson Principal Name" `
      -IsAccepted:$true `
      -IsOffered:$true `
      -IsRequired:$false `
      -Notes "A scoped identifier for a person. It should be represented in the form 'user@scope' where 'user' is a name-based identifier for the person and where 'scope' defines a local security domain. Each value of 'scope' defines a namespace within which the assigned identifiers MUST be unique. Given this rule, if two eduPersonPrincipalName (ePPN) values are the same at a given point in time, they refer to the same person. There must be one and only one '@' sign in valid values of eduPersonPrincipalName."
}

```

An example [claim-descriptions.ps1](/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/claim-descriptions.ps1.txt) PowerShell script that adds descriptions for all of SAFIRE's attributes is available to help you with this.

# Improving generated metadata

By default, ADFS publishes its generated metadata at a well-known URL of:

* https://<em>your-adfs-server.example.ac.za</em>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml

You can use this to obtain the copy of metadata you need to supply to SAFIRE. However, but default the auto-generated metadata does not include many of the [required elements](/technical/saml2/idp-requirements/).

You can improve the generated metadata (and thus require less editing) by providing ADFS with some information about your organisation. To do this, open AD FS Management, select the service and then click on _Edit Federation Service…_. In the resulting properties dialogue, complete the organisational information on the _Organization_ tab and check the _Publish organization information in federation metadata_ checkbox.

Note that you'll still need to add your contacts and some of the MDUI elements (such as your logo URL and privacy statement) by hand before sending your metadata to SAFIRE. We're not aware of any way to get ADFS to add these automatically.
