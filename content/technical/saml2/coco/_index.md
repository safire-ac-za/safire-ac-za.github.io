The [GÉANT Code of Conduct for Service Providers](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/CODE/Code+of+Conduct+for+Service+Providers) (CoCo) provides an approach for service providers who need to meet the European Union's data protection directive and/or the general data protection regulations. It may be required by SAFIRE service providers that provide services to European entities.

### Attesting CoCo compliance

If you need to attest to your service provider's CoCo compliance, in addition to a [registration request]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/forms.md" >}}) you also need to supply a statement of your CoCo compliance. You should be aware that, unlike [Sirtfi]({{< relref "../sirtfi/_index.md" >}}), CoCo introduces binding obligations on the organisation attesting compliance and operating the service provider.

You can use the following template:

  * [SAFIRE CoCo Compliance Template](./SAFIRE-CoCo-Compliance-Template.docx)

This statement must be on institional letterhead, and should be signed by your institution's Information Officer (as defined in the Protection of Personal Information Act).

### CoCo-compliant entities

The following entities in SAFIRE have already attested their CoCo compliance and have this asserted in metadata:
