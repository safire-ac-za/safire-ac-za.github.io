  Single-valued, usually the same as "_givenName_ _sn_".

  Whilst ordering of names is culturally specific, _displayName_ will be generated by the Federation Operator as [givenName](/technical/attributes/givenname/) + [sn](/technical/attributes/sn/) if not supplied by the identity provider. **This behaviour is deprecated and may be discontinued after the end of March 2021**
