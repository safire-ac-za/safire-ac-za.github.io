_Note: support for this attribute was discontinued on 21 October 2019 after [consultation with the community](https://lists.tenet.ac.za/sympa/arc/safire-discuss/2019-10/msg00000.html) --- it was originally added to support the NRF [RIMS](http://www.nrf.ac.za/research-platforms/research-information-management-system) which failed to materialise, and it was never consumed by any service provider._
