# Federation operations staff

During South African working hours (typically [Monday-Friday, 9AM-5PM UTC+2](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/personal.html?cities=56,1440,136,16,26,125,170,47,196,248,22,44,33,64,137,179,220&wch=3)), you can reach federation operations staff using the following contact details:

Email
: {{< email "safire@tenet.ac.za" >}}

Telephone
: [+27.21.763.7156](tel:+27.21.763.7156)

All federation operations staff understand and will honour the [traffic light protocol](https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp), and follow the [Sirtfi norms](https://refeds.org/sirtfi). In addition, these staff routinely make use of S/MIME for email communication and can communicate using PGP if required.

# CSIRT

The South African NREN operates a sector CSIRT consisting of two parts: a proactive and a reactive component. [RFC 2350 information is available](https://csirt.sanren.ac.za/rfc2350.html). Note, however, that not all recipients of email to this address will honour the traffic light protocol. In addition, use of cryptography may be variable.

# After hours

During reasonable waking hours, email sent to the [federation operations staff]({{< relref "#federation-operations-staff" >}}) will likely be read within a few hours.

Outside these times or when an incident is urgent or time critical, TENET operates a 24&times;7&times;365 first-level [service support centre](https://www.tenet.ac.za/service-support), reachable at:

Telephone
: **[+27.21.763.7147](tel:+27.21.763.7147)**

The SSC does not routinely handle security incidents and may not honour the traffic light protocol. However they have an on-call list available and can reach an appropriate security contact in an emergency.
