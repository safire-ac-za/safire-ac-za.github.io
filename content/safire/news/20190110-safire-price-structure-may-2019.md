title: New SAFIRE Cost Structure from May 2019
---

In terms of section 3.3.2 of the [SAFIRE Participation Agreement]({{< ref "/safire/policy/participation/_index.md" >}}), TENET --- as the Federation Operator --- hereby gives notice of a new cost structure with effect from 1 May 2019.<!--more-->

The new cost structures for the SAML technology profile were approved by the [SAFIRE steering committee]({{< ref "/safire/governance.md" >}}) at their December meeting, and are now detailed on SAFIRE's web pages. Separate costs apply for [SAML identity providers]({{< ref "/participants/idp/fees.md" >}}) and [SAML service providers]({{< ref "/participants/sp/fees.md" >}}), and these are listed under each provider type's "fees" page.

The net effect of the new cost structure is that **all existing participants of the federation will continue to enjoy the benefits of the federation without additional charge**. However, from the effective date, some new service and identity providers will become liable for costs as detailed in the fees document.
