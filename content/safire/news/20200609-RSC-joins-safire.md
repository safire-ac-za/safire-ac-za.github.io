title: "Royal Society of Chemistry joins SAFIRE"
---
In April 2020, SAFIRE was approached by the [Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)](https://www.rsc.org/) who expressed interest in joining SAFIRE as a Service Provider. We are pleased to announce that technical integration is now complete, and the RSC are now listed as a [Service Provider](https://safire.ac.za/participants/sp/list/). 

This now means federated authentication from SAFIRE's [participating Institutions](https://safire.ac.za/participants/idp/list/) is now possible. For information on this, please visit our [library information provider page]({{< ref "/technical/resources/library-services.md#royal-society-of-chemistry" >}}).

Welcome RSC!
