Upon request from our colleagues at [Nelson Mandela University](https://mandela.ac.za/), [Rhodes University](https://ru.ac.za/), and the [University of Cape Town](https://uct.ac.za/), SAFIRE have worked with [Kortext](https://www.kortext.com/), and these institutions in allowing easy integration to Kortext's online textbook solutions.

For information on this, please visit our [library information provider page](https://safire.ac.za/technical/resources/library-services/#12).

If your institution is not yet a member of SAFIRE, you can find out how to go about [joining SAFIRE here](https://safire.ac.za/participants/idp/join/).
