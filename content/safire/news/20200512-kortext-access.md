title: "Kortext textbook solutions accessible via your home institution"
---
While [Kortex](https://www.kortext.com/) have temporarily made limited free access available under their Free Student eTextbook Programme [FSTP](https://www.kortext.com/free-student-etextbook-programme/), federated authentication using institutional credentials is also now possible.<!--more-->

Based upon a request from our colleagues at [Nelson Mandela University](https://mandela.ac.za/), [Rhodes University](https://ru.ac.za/), and the [University of Cape Town](https://uct.ac.za/), SAFIRE have worked with Kortext, and these institutions thus simplifying integration into Kortext's online textbook solutions for all current [SAFIRE Participants](https://safire.ac.za/participants/idp/list/).

For information on this, please visit our [library information provider page](https://safire.ac.za/technical/resources/library-services/#12).

If your institution is not yet a member of SAFIRE, you can find out how to go about [joining SAFIRE here](https://safire.ac.za/participants/idp/join/).
