# https://safire.ac.za/
This is the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) source for SAFIRE's website at <https://safire.ac.za/>.

SAFIRE's website was originally created using Wordpress. For various
reasons it was decided to abandon Wordpress in favour of a modern static
site generator, and Hugo was chosen. During the initial import, every
effort was made to preserve existing URLs and the
[current theme](https://github.com/safire-ac-za/safire.ac.za-website/tree/master/themes).

One substantial benefit of this approach is
increased transparency, particularly around changes to
[policies](https://safire.ac.za/safire/policies/). The Hugo source is
stored in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/safire-ac-za/safire.ac.za-website),
allowing Participants to peruse the commit history of any document.
